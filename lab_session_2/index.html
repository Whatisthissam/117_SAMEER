            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born on February 19, 1630, at Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra, was a legendary warrior and the founder of the Maratha Empire. Raised by his deeply spiritual and strong-willed mother Jijabai, and trained in martial arts, governance, and Hindu philosophy, Shivaji developed a vision of Swarajya (self-rule) from an early age. He began his military campaigns in his teens, capturing strategic forts like Torna, Rajgad, and Sinhagad, and built a formidable empire through brilliant guerrilla tactics known as "Ganimi Kava." Shivaji challenged powerful adversaries including the Adil Shahi Sultanate, the Nizam of Golconda, and the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb. His legendary encounters, such as the killing of Afzal Khan and the daring escape from Agra, highlighted his courage and tactical genius. He established a well-organized administration based on justice, efficiency, and inclusivity, and also created a strong naval presence to protect the Konkan coast. Shivaji was coronated as Chhatrapati (sovereign king) in 1674 at Raigad Fort, marking the formal foundation of the Maratha Empire. He passed away on April 3, 1680, but remains a symbol of pride, valor, and patriotism in Indian history.
